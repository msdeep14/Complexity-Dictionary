# Complexity-Dictionary

Dictionary implementation for comparing time complexity of Tries, AVL Tree, RedBlack Tree and HashMaps

## Project Design

1. System checks running time of building and searching word in dictionary.
2. Tries, AVL Tree and RedBlack is implemented and HashMaps is used as an inbuilt library.

## Analysis

#### Building dictionary

For building up whole dictionary(36,351 entries), AVL Tree is a clear loser and HashMap and RedBlack Tree has nearly similar build up time.

#### Search

HashMap is a clear winner, while AVL and RedBlack took nearly the same time.


## Development

Complete project is developed on eclipse platform.
